# Visual Reporter

## Background

The `@wdio/visual-service` has a reporting output since [v5.2.0](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/releases/tag/%40wdio%2Fvisual-service%405.2.0) which will output the diffs into a large JSON file. This project is a sample of what people could do with the output.
