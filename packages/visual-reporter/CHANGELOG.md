### Minor Changes

#### Fix [522](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/issues/522): visual-reporter logs an error when there is no diff file

The output contained a `diffFolderPath` when no diff was present. This resulted in an error in the logs which is fixed with this PR

#### Fix [524](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/issues/524): Highlights are shown after re-render

When a diff is highlighted and the page was re-rendered it also showed the highlighted box again. This was very confusing and annoying

#### 💅 New Feature: Add ignore boxes on the canvas

If ignore boxes are used then the canvas will also show them

### NEW PACKAGE

This is the first release of the new `@wdio/visual-reporter` module. With this module, in combination with the `@wdio/visual-service` module, you can now create beautiful HTML reports where you can view the results.

To make use of this utility, you need to have the 'output.json' file generated by the Visual Testing service. This file is only generated when you have the following in your configuration:

```ts
export const config = {
    // ...
    services: [
        [
            // Also installed as a dependency
            "visual-regression",
            {
                createJsonReportFiles: true,
            },
        ],
    ],
    },
}
```

For more information, please refer to the WebdriverIO Visual Testing [documentation](https://webdriver.io/docs/visual-testing).

#### Installation

The easiest way is to keep `@wdio/visual-reporter` as a dev-dependency in your `package.json`, via:

```sh
npm install @wdio/visual-reporter --save-dev
```
