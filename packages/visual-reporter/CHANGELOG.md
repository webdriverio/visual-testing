  # Fix [522](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/issues/522): visual-reporter logs an error when there is no diff file

  The output contained a `diffFolderPath` when no diff was present. This resulted in an error in the logs which is fixed with this PR

  # Fix [524](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/issues/524): Highlights are shown after re-render

  When a diff is highlighted and the page was re-rendered it also showed the highlighted box again. This was very confusing and annoying

  # 💅 New Feature: Add ignore boxes on the canvas

  If ignore boxes are used then the canvas will also show them

  # 💅 New Feature: Add hover effects on the diff and ignore boxes

  When you now hover over a diff or ignore area you will now see that the box will be highlighted and has a text above it

  **Diff area**

  # 💅 New Feature: Remove diff image before comparing

  This solves the issue [425](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/issues/425) of removing a diff image from the diff folder for success. We now remove the "previous" diff image before we execute the compare so we also have the latest, or we now have a diff image after a retry where the first run failed and produced an image and a new successful run.

  # 💅 Update dependencies

  We've update all dependencies.

## 0.1.7

### NEW PACKAGE

This is the first release of the new `@wdio/visual-reporter` module. With this module, in combination with the `@wdio/visual-service` module, you can now create beautiful HTML reports where you can view the results.

To make use of this utility, you need to have the 'output.json' file generated by the Visual Testing service. This file is only generated when you have the following in your configuration:

```ts
export const config = {
    // ...
    services: [
        [
            // Also installed as a dependency
            "visual-regression",
            {
                createJsonReportFiles: true,
            },
        ],
    ],
    },
}
```

For more information, please refer to the WebdriverIO Visual Testing [documentation](https://webdriver.io/docs/visual-testing).

#### Installation

The easiest way is to keep `@wdio/visual-reporter` as a dev-dependency in your `package.json`, via:

```sh
npm install @wdio/visual-reporter --save-dev
```
