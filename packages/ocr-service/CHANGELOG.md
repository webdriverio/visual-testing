## 2.2.9

### Patch Changes

- db33fa7: #### `@wdio/image-comparison-core` and `@wdio/ocr-service` Security: update jimp (CVE in `file-type` transitive dep)

  Bumped `jimp` to the latest version to resolve a reported vulnerability in its `file-type` transitive dependency (see [#1130](https://github.com/webdriverio/visual-testing/issues/1130), raised by [@denis-sokolov](https://github.com/denis-sokolov), thank you!).

  **Actual impact on these packages**
  `file-type` is used by `@jimp/core` solely to detect image MIME types when reading a buffer. In both `@wdio/image-comparison-core` and `@wdio/ocr-service`, every image passed to jimp originates from either WebDriver screenshots (browser-controlled base64 data) or local files written by the framework itself. There is no code path where untrusted external input is fed directly into jimp, which removes the exploitability that the CVE describes.

  That said, the reputational and compliance risk was real, security scanners flag the package as vulnerable, enterprise users hit audit failures, and some organisations block installation of packages with known CVEs. The update addresses all of that.

  #### `@wdio/visual-reporter` and `@wdio/visual-service`

  Updated internal dependencies to pick up the jimp bump in `@wdio/image-comparison-core`.

# d76044f 🐛 Fix ERR_BUFFER_OUT_OF_BOUNDS for multiremote

Functions in utils such as `getData.ts` used the global `browser`, but this is not browser is not the browser making for example the `ocrClick` function call when the we are running in the multiremote context. This could lead to `ERR_BUFFER_OUT_OF_BOUNDS` error. This release fixes that error.

  #### 🚀 New Features

  **Added Reporting output**
  You now have the option to export the compare results into a JSON report file. By enabling the module option `createJsonReportFiles: true`, each image that is compared will create a report stored in the `actual` folder, next to each `actual` image result.

  The output will look like this:

  ```json
  {
    "parent": "check methods",
    "test": "should fail comparing with a baseline",
    "tag": "examplePageFail",
    "instanceData": {
      "browser": {
        "name": "chrome-headless-shell",
        "version": "126.0.6478.183"
      },
      "platform": {
        "name": "mac",
        "version": "not-known"
      }
    },
    "commandName": "checkScreen",
    "boundingBoxes": {
      "diffBoundingBoxes": [
        {
          "left": 1088,
          "top": 717,
          "right": 1186,
          "bottom": 730
        }
        //....
      ],
      "ignoredBoxes": [
        {
          "left": 159,
          "top": 652,
          "right": 356,
          "bottom": 703
        }
        //...
      ]
    },
    "fileData": {
      "actualFilePath": "/Users/wswebcreation/Git/wdio/visual-testing/.tmp/actual/desktop_chrome-headless-shellexamplePageFail-local-chrome-latest-1366x768.png",
      "baselineFilePath": "/Users/wswebcreation/Git/wdio/visual-testing/localBaseline/desktop_chrome-headless-shellexamplePageFail-local-chrome-latest-1366x768.png",
      "diffFilePath": "/Users/wswebcreation/Git/wdio/visual-testing/.tmp/diff/desktop_chrome-headless-shell/examplePageFail-local-chrome-latest-1366x768png",
      "fileName": "examplePageFail-local-chrome-latest-1366x768.png",
      "size": {
        "actual": {
          "height": 768,
          "width": 1366
        },
        "baseline": {
          "height": 768,
          "width": 1366
        },
        "diff": {
          "height": 768,
          "width": 1366
        }
      }
    },
    "misMatchPercentage": "12.90",
    "rawMisMatchPercentage": 12.900729014153246
  }
  ```

  When all tests are executed, a new JSON file with the collection of the comparisons will be generated and can be found in the root of your actual folder. The data is grouped by:

  - `describe` for Jasmine/Mocha or `Feature` for CucumberJS
  - `it` for Jasmine/Mocha or `Scenario` for CucumberJS

  and then sorted by:

  - `commandName`, which are the compare method names used to compare the images
  - `instanceData`, browser first, then device, then platform

  it will look like this

  ```json
  [
    {
      "description": "check methods",
      "data": [
        {
          "test": "should fail comparing with a baseline",
          "data": [
            {
              "tag": "examplePageFail",
              "instanceData": {},
              "commandName": "checkScreen",
              "framework": "mocha",
              "boundingBoxes": {
                "diffBoundingBoxes": [],
                "ignoredBoxes": []
              },
              "fileData": {},
              "misMatchPercentage": "14.34",
              "rawMisMatchPercentage": 14.335403703025868
            },
            {
              "tag": "exampleElementFail",
              "instanceData": {},
              "commandName": "checkElement",
              "framework": "mocha",
              "boundingBoxes": {
                "diffBoundingBoxes": [],
                "ignoredBoxes": []
              },
              "fileData": {},
              "misMatchPercentage": "1.34",
              "rawMisMatchPercentage": 1.335403703025868
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  ```

  The report data will give you the opportunity to build your own visual report without doing all the magic and data collection yourself.

- a924dfc: # 🚀 New Feature

  Sometimes it can be hard to find an element in a mobile native app or desktop site, with an interactable Canvas, with the default [WebdriverIO selectors](https://webdriver.io/docs/selectors). In that case, it would be nice if you would be able to use something like OCR ([Optical Character Recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition)) to interact with elements on your device/screen.

  The new `@wdio/ocr-service` service provides you with the option to interact with elements based on **visible text**. It will provide multiple commands to:

  - wait
  - search
  - and interact

  with an element, all based on text.

  The following commands will be added

  - `ocrGetText`
  - `ocrGetElementPositionByText`
  - `ocrWaitForTextDisplayed`
  - `ocrClickOnText`
  - `ocrSetValue`

    A CLI command will also be provided to pre-check text received from the image, this can be run by using the command `npx ocr-service`. For a demo check this video
