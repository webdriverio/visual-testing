## 💥  Major Release: New @wdio/image-comparison-core Package

### 🏗️  Architectural Refactor

This release introduces a **completely new core architecture** with the dedicated `@wdio/image-comparison-core` package, replacing the generic `webdriver-image-comparison` module with a WDIO-specific solution.

#### What was the problem?
- The old `webdriver-image-comparison` package was designed for generic webdriver usage
- Complex integration between generic and WDIO-specific code
- Limited test coverage (~58%) making maintenance difficult
- Mixed responsibilities between core logic and service integration

#### What changed?
✅ **New dedicated core package**: `@wdio/image-comparison-core` - purpose-built for WebdriverIO
✅ **Cleaner architecture**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns
✅ **Enhanced test coverage**: Improved from ~58% to ~90% across all metrics
✅ **Better maintainability**: Organized codebase with comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
✅ **WDIO-specific dependencies**: Only depends on `@wdio/logger`, `@wdio/types`, etc.

### 🧪 Testing Improvements

- **100% branch coverage** on critical decision points
- **Comprehensive unit tests** for all major functions
- **Optimized mocks** for complex scenarios
- **Better test isolation** and reliability

| Before/After | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines |
| ------------ | ------- | -------- | ------- | ------- |
| **Previous** | 58.59   | 91.4     | 80.71   | 58.59   |
| **After refactor** | 90.55 | 96.38    | 93.99   | 90.55   |

### 🔧 Service Integration

The `@wdio/visual-service` now imports from the new `@wdio/image-comparison-core` package while maintaining the same public API and functionality for users.

### 📈 Performance & Quality

- **Modular architecture**: Easier to maintain and extend
- **Type safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage
- **Clean exports**: Well-defined public API
- **Internal interfaces**: Proper separation of concerns

### 🔄 Backward Compatibility

✅ **No breaking changes** for end users
✅ **Same public API** maintained
✅ **Existing configurations** continue to work
✅ **All existing functionality** preserved

### 🎯 Future Benefits

This refactor sets the foundation for:
- Easier addition of new features
- Better bug fixing capabilities
- Enhanced mobile and native app support
- More reliable MultiRemote functionality

### 📦 Dependency Updates
- Updated most dependencies to their latest versions
- Improved security with latest package versions
- Better compatibility with current WebdriverIO ecosystem
- Enhanced performance through updated dependencies

---

**Note**: This is an architectural improvement that modernizes the codebase while maintaining full backward compatibility. All existing functionality remains unchanged for users.
